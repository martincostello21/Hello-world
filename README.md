attempt at creating a workflow-dispatch... hear goes

Running a workflow using the REST API
When using the REST API, you configure the inputs and ref as request body parameters. If the inputs are omitted, the default values defined in the workflow file are used.

Note: You can define up to 10 inputs for a workflow_dispatch event.

For more information about using the REST API, see the "Create a workflow dispatch event."
